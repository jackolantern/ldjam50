# The Idea

You are a vampire, and Van Helsing has stolen your coffin.
The sun is fast approaching, so you better catch him quick or you're toast!

You can always see where Van Helsing (or rather, your coffin) is on the map.
Each turn you come to a fork in the road.  A fork can be four ways `+` or three ways `T` (or upsidedown or sideways `T`.)
Each road will have either:

- Nothing
- A garlic (slows you down one turn)
- A mirror (slows you down one turn)
- A gold coin
- A diamond (10 coins)
- A person (drink their blood to get a free turn.)
- A store
  - Buy a hammer to bypass a mirror
  - Buy a clothespin to bypass a garlic (I guess you pinch your nose or something?  I don't know.)
  - A blood bank (buy blood to get a free turn.)

Each turn the sun advances (Not sure how much.  Needs testing.)
If you catch VH (unlikely) you win.  Otherwise the sun will eventually catch up to you.
